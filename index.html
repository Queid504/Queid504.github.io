    <p>If there’s one thing that has better my profession, my skill, and my overall ability to do the things I love around my studio- it’s my Wacom tablet; the Cintiq 13 HD, of which is one of, if not one of the best graphic tablets out there in this day and age for digital artists like myself. </p>

	<p>With the dimensions of 14.75 in x 9.75 in, the tablet has a lot of capability and a screen that emulates anything happening on your original display, allowing from perfect accuracy unlike other tablets, where it’s more of hand-eye coordination as the tablet is just a normal piece of plastic. </p>
	<p>The tablets materials are comprised of plastic, lines of rubber on the sides to be comfortable, and lastly, all of the circuits, pins, and sensors working their technological magic on the inside- combining the likes of force/pressure sensors, along with a semi-magnetic sensor that tracks the tip of the pen, allowing it to act as a secondary mouse. </p>
	<p>Continuing from it’s interior functionality, second comes the tablet’s button functions- which come on the left side of the tablet, represented by 2 buttons on top, the bottom, and a circular 4-sided directional key with a button on the middle- in total as 9 buttons. The 2 buttons on the top and bottom act as changes to the properties of the tablet, being the first summons its settings, the 2nd summons its “radical menu”, which is shortcuts to things like brushes, layers, etc. The 3rd acts as the Alt button, while the 4th acts as a pan/scroll.</p>
	<p>Moving on from there, the circular and button on the middle are more as quick tools- being that pressing left undoes your last action, the up summons a “precision” mode that acts as a magnifying glass, the right button allows the tablet to switch its displays, in case you have more than one display, and the down acts as the Ctrl button. The middle button, lastly, summons the Windows menu.</p>
	<p>The last few functions that come with the product of the tablet is the pen that comes with it, having 4 essentials to it- the front nub, the back nub, and the two buttons on the side. The nubs on the front are small, yet a bit thicker than your average pencil tip. This is used for the usual tools in graphic design programs- the pens, the brushes, the paint buckets- anything that may require long or repeated clicks. These numbs, however, do wear out due to their small size, but thankfully, it does come with replacements.</p>
	<p>This is not the case with the back nub, fortunately, as its bigger size is more reminiscent of an eraser, which is what it’s commonly used for. It’s pretty simplistic due to that, but its big size does also prolong a replacement- which is nice. This is followed up by the two buttons, which either replace the right click or double left click of a mouse. Other than that- its still pretty useful despite its simplicity. </p>
	<p>Other than the overall tool that I use to grow my skill and fascination with the Graphic Design field, its mostly the amount of time and money I save with it that really does make it one of my prized possessions. Not spending so much on new supplies or paper definitely helps a lot in the house, and experimenting with new tools is also fantastic in my opinion. I am quite grateful for it.  </p>
